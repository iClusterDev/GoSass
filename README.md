# GoSass

A Tiny Boiler Plate for your SASS Workflows with a Browser Sync functionality.

<!-- ## Getting Started

Simply download the .zip file and extract the content.
Copy the Gulpfile, the package.json and the src folder into your working directory.  -->

### Prerequisites

To use GoSass you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

### Installing

Simply download the .zip file and extract the content.
Copy the Gulpfile, the package.json and the src folder into your working directory.

Now run:

```
npm install
```
After all the packages are installed run:

```
npm start
```

In your working folder a css/style.css will be automatically generated. On every file save (.html or .sass), your .sass file gets re-compiled into the .css file.

You are now all set.
Happy Dev!
